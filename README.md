# Relics & Ruins

### Created by Michele Cicerale and Riccardo Cei

Welcome to **Relics & Ruins**, a turn-based RPG game designed and programmed in C++ by Michele Cicerale and Riccardo Cei. In this game, you will embark on an epic journey through dangerous dungeons, gather ancient relics, battle formidable monsters, and manage your resources wisely to conquer the challenges ahead.

## Features

- **Multiple Difficulty Modes**: Choose between **Easy, Medium, Hard**, and **Extreme** modes, each offering unique challenges with varying enemy strength, item availability, and strategic depth.
  
- **Character Creation**: Start your adventure by creating your own character. Choose a name, race, and gender to personalize your hero.

- **Dungeon Exploration**: Traverse through interconnected dungeon rooms, each offering different encounters:
  - Fight monsters in turn-based battles.
  - Discover hidden treasures and relics.
  - Mine resources that can be sold back in town.
  
- **NPC Interaction**: Upon entering the game, you’ll meet an NPC who guides you through the mechanics and prepares you for your quest to defeat the dungeon bosses threatening the kingdom.

- **Strategic Gameplay**: Manage your character’s health, energy, and hunger levels. Use resources like food and potions wisely, and choose whether to rest, attack, or explore further.

- **Boss Battles**: At the end of each dungeon, face a powerful boss that must be defeated to progress.

- **Marketplace**: After completing a dungeon, return to the town to sell your gathered loot, purchase new equipment, and prepare for the next dungeon challenge.

  - Fastest dungeon completions (measured in turns).
  - Most or least amount of money spent.
  - Highest or lowest character levels.
